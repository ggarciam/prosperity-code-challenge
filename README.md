# Prosperity Code Challenge

Gonzalo Garcia's solution to the Prosperity Code Challenge.

# Brief Explanation

Even when I'm not that experienced with React, I decided to create the app with React and Redux, which took
me more time than what I expected at the beginning.

Working also with the new Router structure (v4) was a handicap for me, cause I had to learn how it was working 
and delayed me also in the process.

Because of this reasons, it took me the 4 hours that were estimated as a maximum to create this solution.

## Tasks

In order to run the project, use the following task:

* `run npm start` for a dev server. It opens automatically a browser window.
